# curious-tunes

Initially I started off as a fork of https://github.com/PDavid/aTunes aTunes which I adjust to my own wishes. 
It appeared to be too complex, so I decided to start off a new project, but still try and reuse some portions of code.
But later I realized that there is nothing I can salvage - it is easier to vibecode/write it from scratch.
Soo, I'm keeping a reference to a aTunes just as a memento...
